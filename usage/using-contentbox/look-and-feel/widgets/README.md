# Widgets

Widgets are small pieces of software that you can add to your ContentBox website to perform a specific function. There are several Widgets built into ContentBox that are used for various parts of your website, and you can insert widgets into blog posts and pages to make your website even more dynamic.

Widgets are one of the ways ContentBox is extendable, you can install modules and themes that overwrite existing widgets, or are brand new... or you can create or customize your own widgets.

Widgets are maintained through the Administrator under `Look & Feel > Widgets`. You can managing existing widgets, upload new widgets, or download widgets from Forgebox.
