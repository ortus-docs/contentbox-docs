# Using a Module

## Simplest way to access a module

To view a Module, with routing and ColdBox modules entry points, you can simply hit a url/route on your site, and the module is ready to go.

For example: [http://www.yoursite.com/businessLogicScanner](http://www.yoursite.com/businessLogicScanner)

That is all you have to do. You don't need to build a special widget to display the module, the module can be accessed by the entry point in the module configuration, and its as easy as that.
