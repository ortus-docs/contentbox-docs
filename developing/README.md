# Developing For ContentBox

ContentBox's modular architecture, combined with the awesome power of the [ColdBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/coldbox) MVC development framework, allows for a familiar, yet unrestricted, platform from which to develop great web applications.

If you're a Front End Developer, you'll appreciate the straightforward configuration and pre-defined ( but highly customizable! ) asset conventions.  

Within the [ColdBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/coldbox) framework, itself ContentBox is comprised of three modules:

* `contentbox` - Includes the the underlying libraries for content organization and presentation
* `contentbox-admin` - Provides the administrative interface for managing your CMS
* `contentbox-ui` - Provides shared libraries for the user interface which are used for presentation and which may be extended to your application requirements.
