# Markdown Support

Developers are getting more and more familiar with Markdown, and it's actually preferred by a lot of developers when it comes to writing documentation and blog posts, and that is why we give you native support of Markdown in the ContentBox editor. We also threw in a few other features when adding support, some might just save you hours of work.

We have included a new code editor that supports HTML and Markdown natively. This will allow developers or editors to write in native markup and have all the integrations into ContentBox.

The new editor also sports real time previews and side-by-side editing in full screen. Your editing experience is about to get a whole lot better now.
