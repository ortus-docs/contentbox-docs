# About

Our about page is very useful. Apart from your build information, it contains keyboard shortcuts! ContentBox has a lot of keyboard shortcuts available for you, and once they are memorized, you can easily navigate using them. Also, for you module developers, we have an API based on a jquery javascript library. You can do data binding for your own shortcuts, so it's very easy if you want to offer your own keyboard shortcuts.
