# Export

Whether you have a website with a lot of traffic, or not, it pays to have a test / staging site setup to test out changes to your website. One of the biggest problems with having a staging and production website, is moving data from one environment into another. This need inspired the Content Import and Export features in ContentBox.

The Import and Export tools are located in the Admin menu under Tools.

From this panel you can choose to export your entire site or parts of it as a \*.box archive package.

![Export Tools Options - Everything or Picky](../../../assets/cbcms\_export\_option.jpg)

You have 2 options, Export everything, and Mr Picky, where you can pick and choose.

![Export - Pick and Choose what to export - 3](../../../assets/cbcms\_export\_option\_3.jpg)

As you can see in the pick and choose, there are lots of options. Pages, Entries, Categories, ContentStore, Authors, Roles, Permissions, Security Rules, Settings and much more. This makes it easy to pick and choose the content you need to move.

When you are ready, you can click Export Preview to see exactly what will be exported ( see below ).

Once complete, you will be prompted to save your cbox file.

Once you have exported your content into a cbox file, you can import it to the installation of your choice, through `Tools > Import`
