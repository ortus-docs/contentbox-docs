# Media Manager

\[Content + Media manager] Media manager is an embedded media manager that we ship with ColdBox. If you are an administrator you have different libraries \[Switch Library drop down menu; top right] that you can manage. For example, \[click widgets in the DDM] you can manage the widgets, so you can install manually other widgets or download some of the widgets that you have available here.

\[Switch Library + Update] You can check out the auto update channel so you can actually do any type of modifications. It’s up to you what you want to do with this \[switch to list view]. Obviously, an administrator can choose all the different things \[select new ‘blog folder’ & click X to delete] and all different permissions. You can do this \[hover in circle] as well.
