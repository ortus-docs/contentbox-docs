**Disable Blog:**  You can disable the Blog for the entire ContentBox website. This does not delete data, it just disables blog features... including the addition of a Menu Item called `Blog` if you are using the default page navigation.

_Note: If you disable the blog, remember to change the `Home Page Display` above to a real page and not the blog listing if you are disabling the blog._

**Blog Entry Point:** Choose the entry point in the URL to trigger the blog engine. The usual defautl entry point pattern is `blog`. Do not use symbols or slashes (/ \)

## Site Maintenance

**Site Maintenance:** You can put your entire site in maintenance mode if you are doing upgrades. This will make it easier to work on major changes to the site without customers seeing half completed work. The site will display a Offline Message, set in the `Offline Message` field, unless the Theme has a custom Maintenance Layout or Maintenance View.

**Offline Message:** The message to show users once the site is in maintenance mode, HTML is ok.

### Viewing the Site while in Maintenance Mode

If you are logged in, with the `MAINTENANCE_MODE_VIEWER` permission, you will be able to view the site even when the site is in Maintenance Mode. When the site is in Maintenance Mode, you will see a Red Maintenance banner, to remind you the site is in Maintenance for other users.
