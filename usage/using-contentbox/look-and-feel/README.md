# Look & Feel

\[Look & Feel + Layouts] Now, Look and Feel are obviously very important. So you have our layouts section. As you can see some of our sections are tied to forgebox \[ForgeBox upper right corner].

Again this is administration permission, but you can actually talk into ForgeBox \[click ForgeBox] so you can connect to ForgeBox. It will bring you all the different setups available that you can install immediately. If you download a layout, for example, you can then go to your Manage Layouts.

\[click manage layouts / left side panel] and you can see that the new layout will be there. If you want to set it as your current layout you can go ahead and activate it \[click Activate for the layout]. You can go to your site and check your new layout. So very easy \[back to admin \\/ active layout] you can now start skinning or downloading themes.

If you are building themes just please remember to contribute to ForgeBox so everybody can benefit.

\[Manage Layouts] Management is for you to be able to see which layouts you have. Activate them, upload them, if you need to upload a new theme \[Upload layout / up right], rebuild the internal registry, or do any kind of clean up.
