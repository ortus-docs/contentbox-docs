# Menu Manager

The menu manager allows you to create 'Menus' to be used in a variety of ways in your ContentBox Website. A Menu can contains several Items, which can be from a range of Item types, Content like Pages and Blog posts, Media, Submenus, URLs, JS or Free type. Menus are easy to create, and give you a lot more options that relying on pages inside your traditional Sitemap structure.

By default, ContentBox sites use the Sitemap to generate a menu for display. To use a Menu instead of the Sitemap, you have to install a Theme which supports Menus, and then select the Menu you wish to use as you main site Menu.

Some Themes may support additional menus for top menus, footer menus, side bar menus. Please refer to your Theme.
